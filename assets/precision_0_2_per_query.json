I would like to use the question score, but remove the bias due to the number of views, but I don't know how to approach this rigorously.\\\\n\\\\nIn the ideal world, I could sort the questions by calculating $\\\\frac{v}{n}$, where $v$ is the votes total and $n$ is the number of views. After all it would measure the percentage of people that upvote the question, minus the percentage of people that downvote the question.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, the voting pattern is much more complicated. Votes tend to \"plateau\" to a certain level and this has the effect of drastically underestimating wildly popular questions. In practice, a question with 1 view and 1 upvote would certainly score and be sorted higher than any other question with 10,000 views, but less than 10,000 votes.\\\\n\\\\nI am currently using $\\\\frac{v}{\\\\log{n}+1}$ as an empirical formula, but I would like to be precise.

Each **score** represents the exam results for each person in a particular subject. So a score in this case is simply a representation of where a row and column intersect.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Now lets informally define Principal Component Analysis:**\\\\n\\\\nIn the table above, can you easily plot the data in a 2D graph? No, because there are four subjects (which means four variables), i.e.:\\\\n\\\\n - You could plot two subjects in the exact same way you would with x & y co-ordinates in a 2D graph. \\\\n - You could even plot three subjects in the same way you would plot x, y & z in a 3D graph (though this is generally bad practice). \\\\n\\\\nBut how would you plot 4 subjects?\\\\n\\\\nAt the moment we have four variables which each represent just one subject. So a method around this might be to somehow combine the subjects into maybe just two new variables which we can then plot. This is known as *Multidimensional scaling*.\\\\n\\\\nPrincipal Component analysis is a form of multidimensional scaling. It is a linear transformation of the variables into a lower dimensional space which retain maximal amount of information about the variables. For example, this would mean we could compare which person did best across all subjuects. In **R**, this is:\\\\n\\\\n    DF<-data.frame(Maths=c(80, 90, 95), Science=c(85, 85, 80), English=c(60, 70, 40), Music=c(55, 45, 50))\\\\n    prcomp(DF, scale = TRUE)\\\\n\\\\nWhich will give you something like this (first two Principle Components only for sake of simplicity):\\\\n\\\\n                   PC1        PC2   \\\\n    Maths   -0.5477226 -0.4082483 \\\\n    Science  0.6210590 -0.1543033  \\\\n    English  0.5477226 -0.4082483 \\\\n    Music    0.1195229  0.8017837 \\\\n\\\\n**So what is a Principal Component Score?**\\\\n\\\\nIt's a score from the table at the end of this post.\\\\n\\\\nThe output from **R** means we can now plot each persons score across all subjects in a 2D graph as follows:\\\\n\\\\n          x                                      y\\\\n    John -0.55*80 + 0.62*90 + 0.55*60 + 0.12*55  -0.41*80 + -0.15*85 + -0.41*60 + 0.80*55 \\\\n    Mike -0.55*90 + 0.62*85 + 0.55*70 + 0.12*45  -0.41*90 + -0.15*85 + -0.41*70 + 0.80*45\\\\n    Kate -0.55*95 + 0.62*80 + 0.55*40 + 0.12*50  -0.41*95 + -0.15*80 + -0.41*40 + 0.80*50\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhich simplifies to:\\\\n\\\\n          x       y\\\\n    John  51.4    -26.15 \\\\n    Mike  47.1    -42.35\\\\n    Kate  25.35   -27.35\\\\n\\\\nThere are ***six principle component scores*** in the table above. You can now plot the scores in a 2D graph to get a sense of who did best overall across all subjects.\\\\n\\\\nEDIT: Hmm, I probably could have thought up a better example, but I hope you get the idea.\\\\n",
